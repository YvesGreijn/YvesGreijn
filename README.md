### Hi there, appreciate you taking the time to visit my Github page 

- ~~ Hiring senior Software Engineers for TravelPerk (London / Barcelona / Berlin focus)
- ~ Recently hired Poki's Head of Product 
- 🔭 Last long project was my 3y stint working on Executive & Leadership hiring at Miro (Accel / ICONIQ). Ever since mainly working retainers for reputable tech companies. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to master fatherhood (update: learning, not yet mastered. Doubtful I'll ever get there). 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on scraping / algorithms to make my work more efficient (working on it, not yet pushed to my repo's)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with your (Engineering) Leadership hiring needs. This would make the most sense. 
- 💬 Ask me about Interview processes, candidate preparation, interview training and 'signal', eliminating bias, and diversity in the workplace. Etc.
