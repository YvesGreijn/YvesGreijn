### Hi there, appreciate you taking the time to visit my Github page 

- ðŸ”­ Last long project was my 3y stint working on Executive & Leadership hiring at Miro (Accel / ICONIQ). Ever since mainly working retainers for reputable tech companies. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to master fatherhood (update: learning, not yet mastered. Doubtful I'll ever get there). 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on scraping / algorithms to make my work more efficient (working on it, not yet pushed to my repo's)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with your (Engineering) Leadership hiring needs. This would make the most sense. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Interview processes, candidate preparation, interview training and 'signal', eliminating bias, and diversity in the workplace. Etc.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: yves dot greijn at mavenheadhunting dot com
